<b>Church Covenant</b></span></p>

<p>Having received the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior, and having been baptized upon a profession of our faith in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, we solemnly enter into covenant with one another, in the presence of God, to walk together as a church of Jesus Christ, in obedience to all that he has appointed in his written word, as he shall give us light, strength, and opportunity.</p>
